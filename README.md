# UGRB_Phenology
Data to produce results from the paper "Spring phenology of a dryland steppe plant community: Impacts of functional type dynamics on wildlife migration".

The main R scripts are the Phenology.Rmd and the Biomass.Rmd. These are what produce the results and plots using the raw data from the field (Biomass_Data_Engry.csv and Final_Phenology.csv). The other main script is the Migration_Plant_Maps.Rmd. This code was used to create maps and calculate areas of plant community result response to climate change as modeled by STEPWAT. The interpolated STEPWAT model outputs and subsequent results within migration pathways are in Phenology_Paper_Rasters.zip. We cannot share the files used to make the migration pathways, but the information and souce for how to recreate those can be found in Methods.
